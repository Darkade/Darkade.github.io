<h3 id="enforcement">Enforcement</h3>

<h3 id="your-account">Your Account</h3>

<p>In order to use our add-ons you must be authorized to use a Google account.</p>

<p>The creation and usage of this account is subject to Google’s own terms of service and privacy policy.</p>

<p>The company may restrict, or suspend, your access to our services in any way we are able and in accordance to its policy for handling copyright-related takedown requests, or if the company reasonably believes that you’ve broken any rule in these terms.</p>

<h3 id="your-content">Your Content</h3>

<p>Nothing in these terms gives the company any ownership rights in intellectual property that you share with us, such as your account information, posts, or other content you submit to our site or while using our add-ons. Nothing in these terms gives you any ownership rights in the company’s intellectual property, either.</p>

<p>Between you and the company, you remain solely responsible for content and the way you engage with our add-ons. You agree not to wrongly imply that any content you use our add-ons with is sponsored or approved by the company. These terms do not obligate the company to store, maintain, or provide copies of content you submit, and to change it, according to these terms.</p>

<p>Content you submit to us and enter into our add-ons belongs to you, and you decide what permission to give others for it. But at a minimum, you license the company to provide content that you submit to our add-ons to other users.</p>

<p>When content you submit is removed, whether by you or by the company, the company’s special license ends when the last copy disappears from the company’s backups, caches, logs and other systems. Other licenses you apply to content you submit, such as Creative Commons licenses, may continue after your content is removed. Those licenses may give others, or the company itself, the right to share your content again.</p>

<p>Others who receive content you submit to the company addon-ons may violate the terms on which you license your content. You agree that the company will not be liable to you for those violations or their consequences.</p>

<h3 id="your-responsibility">Your Responsibility</h3>

<p>You agree to indemnify the company from legal claims by others related to your breach of these terms, or breach of these terms by others using your account to execute our add-ons. Both you and the company agree to notify the other side of any legal claims for which you might have to indemnify the company as soon as possible. If the company fails to notify you of a legal claim promptly, you won’t have to indemnify the company for damages that you could have defended against or mitigated with prompt notice. You agree to allow the company to control investigation, defense, and settlement of legal claims for which you would have to indemnify the company, and to cooperate with those efforts. The company agrees not to agree to any settlement that admits fault for you or imposes obligations on you without your prior agreement.
Disclaimers</p>

<p>You accept all risk of accessing the site and content on our add-ons. As far as the law allows, the company and its suppliers provide the add-on as is, without any warranty whatsoever.</p>

<p>The site and add-ons may hyperlink to and integrate services run by others. The company does not make any warranty about services run by others, or content they may provide. Use of services run by others may be governed by other terms between you and the one running service.</p>

<h3 id="limits-on-liability">Limits on Liability</h3>

<p>Neither the company nor its suppliers will be liable to you for breach-of-contract damages their personnel could not have reasonably foreseen when you agreed to these terms.</p>

<p>As far as the law allows, the total liability to you for claims of any kind that are related to the site or content of it or the add-on will be limited to $50.</p>

<p>The following provisions survive the end of our agreement: Your Content, Feedback, Your Responsibility, Disclaimers, Limits on Liability, and General Terms.
Disputes</p>

<p>Mexico law will govern any dispute related to these terms or your use of the add-on and services.</p>

<p>If a provision of these terms is unenforceable as written, but could be changed to make it enforceable, that provision should be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. Otherwise, that provision should be removed.</p>

<p>Neither the exercise of any right under this Agreement, nor waiver of any breach of this Agreement, waives any other breach of this Agreement.</p>

<h3 id="contact">Contact</h3>

<p>You may notify the company under these terms, and send questions to the company, at contact@reyescon.de.</p>

<h3 id="changes">Changes</h3>

<p>The company last updated these terms on February 13, 2022, and may update these terms again. The company will post all updates to the site. The company may also announce updates with special messages or alerts on the site or add-ons.</p>

<p>Once you get notice of an update to these terms, you must agree to the new terms in order to keep using the site and add-ons.</p>
