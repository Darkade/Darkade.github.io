## Yonder for Google Sheets

This is an add-on to enable sharing dice rolls within Google Sheets. It works great with many of the online character keeps made by [The Gauntlet Community](https://gauntlet-rpg.com/) and as long as you have an array of names and number stats it should do its job.

However, at the moment, Yonder for Google Sheets works mainly with PbtA-style games that use six-sided dice, all of your rolls at the moment will be `2d6 + stat`.

Support for FitD games is planned, with other rolls or game systems support depending on use and demand.

To install the add-on go here, you will need a Google Account.
