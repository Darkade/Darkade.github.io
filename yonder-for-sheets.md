Yonder Dice Roller for Google Sheets is an add-on to enable sharing dice rolls within Google Sheets.

At the moment this works well with PbtA-style games that use six-sided dice. Support for FitD games is planned, with other rolls or game systems support depending on use and demand.

To install the add-on go here, you will need a Google Account.
