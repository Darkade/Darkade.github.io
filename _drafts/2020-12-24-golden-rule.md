The Golden Rule of TTRPGs is a variation of: _these rules are just recommendations you are the final arbiter of what your game actually needs and you should feel free to ignore or modify these rules as required._ It is very good advice, so why do I have conflicting feelings towards it? Today I argue with myself and get nowhere except a bit enlightened.

The Golden Rule feels like a cop-out right? Like designers, specially so called "AAA" designers and studios use it to justify unclear rules. After all you are at the table, you know what should be done, you have the authority, you don't have to ask them what to do? Isn't that a terrible use of this?
{: .y}

Well saying "designers" is very broad. I personally know designers who think of The Golden Rule as a statement that encourages users to hack, modify and re-skin games. And in that sense it's good not only that as a community we have The Golden Rule, but that we include it in games, again to make that statement.
{: .i}

I can see that, I think. But if we want to encourage people to hack and modify games wouldn't clearer, better written rules do a better job at that? If I don't understand the game how can I be expected to hack the game?
{: .y}

Well that's true, better rules make games easier to hack. But there's an implication there that I think is false: that when people understand games then begin hacking games, and people probably hack games because the are excited by them first and foremost, not because they've "achieved" understanding.
{: .i}

The clear example is D&D, specially in the 80s and 90s, people were very excited about the game even if, from what I gather, nobody truly understood it, because it wasn't _codified_ in the way we think today. And from that excitement came hacks, settings and many other RPGs that drew on D&D.
{: .i}

Ok, then. What do we do? It still feels like The Golden Rule is a get out of making a clear design card.
{: .y}

For starters, acknowledging that the fact that The Golden Rule exists is no reason not to be critical of games and their design; and that both things can co-exist and are not mutually exclusive.
{: .i}

Then re-emphasise that TTRPG rules are there to support Role Playing, which can't happen without the people at the table: _it's not only that you are the final arbiter, or that you should be free to disregard rules, but that **people are more important than rules,** so you should be free to change the experience to suit them._
{: .i}


But, stepping back, why buy games then? If rules don't matter.
{: .y}

Because not everyone can start from scratch. Because mechanics allow for character exploration, outside of the player's personal experience. Because it's an agreed starting point. Because they help _seed_ interactions. Because they give common ground for people to meet and talk.
{: .i}

And what about games with unclear rules?
{: .y}

As I said the positives of TGR do not exempt games from critical analysis and commentary, particularly big mainstream games. Big studios have the resources to develop better clearer rules, and there's an argument to be made that they use those resources to get content volume instead of content quality. So yes let's hold them accountable for that.
{: .i}

However getting to a state where rules are clear for everyone and in every scenario is impossible, or at least takes an incommensurable amount of resources, and that's probably not a factible for independent developers. That's where TGR, and the way communities share their experiences around games, and hacking games, help polish concepts even after release. And that's one of the reasons making these kind of Golden Rule statements is very important.
{: .i}

Also, consider not everyone is coming with a design mindset into gaming, or has design experience like yourself. So while **you know** you must prioritize the needs of your group this might not be clear to everyone, specially new gamers. So, rules that seem clear for you, having experience with TTRPGs, could be unclear to others, and their experience should be more important than playing the game exactly as intended.
{: .i}

Ok, you are talking about resources and how it's not feasible to all developers. But we've seen indie games that are published with guides on how to hack them, even System Reference Documents. So there's no excuse.
{: .y}

That's the thing we've seen _some_ and doing so is not accesible to all developers. Even if it was, publishing such things is not necessarily something developers are interested in doing, either because it would take time and resources, or because they want to move on to other projects. Games like Trophy and Ironsworn were thought to span a development ecosystem; but again, this is not a requirement for games to exist. I'm not even sure if it would be desirable for all games to be their own ecosystem.
{: .i}

So. Is this attitude towards TGR about internalized and intentional gate keeping then?
{: .y}

I don't know. Maybe? More than gatekeeping I think assuming TRG is bad or not required is projecting the experience of, well, experienced players into everyone else, which isn't helpful. The Golden Rule has the advantage of being easy to phrase, before getting to licenses, hack guides, or homebrew.
{: .i}

And it does not exclude experienced players and includes new ones, right?
{: .y}

I think so, yes. Experienced, or design minded players can still talk about the game in those terms without making the experience of playing TTRPGs a ladder that must be climbed; because it shouldn't be.
{: .i}


TTRPGs It should be for everyone who wants to enjoy them.
{: .i}

... who wants to enjoy them.

Thank you for getting this far! This post was inspired by a recent [Adam Neely video]. I like jazz, and I hadn't ever made the connection between these two improvised things before yesterday.

Keeping in the theme of Jazz. Right now I'm writting a very jazzy D&D 5e adventure inspired by the anime classic Cowboy Bebop. It's called [Warlock Pixieland]. You can [follow me on twitter][@darkade] to learn the most recent news about it.

If you'd like to support me check out [Arcane Moon], my previous adventure inspired by 90s Magical Girl anime, specially Sailor Moon.

Thanks for reading!
