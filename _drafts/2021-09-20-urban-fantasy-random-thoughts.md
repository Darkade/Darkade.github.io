<!--INTRO-->
About a year ago I ran Vampire the Masquerade for the first time ever. I ran  few weeks ago I woke up thinking about Matando Cabos, a very good comedy film, and I realized it'd be very fun to play something similar using Fiasco. So that very weekend I sat down and wrote a playset **Fiasco Classic: Busca un Problema.** A playset inspired by 2000s Mexican comedies, specially dark ones, like Matando Cabos, Nicotina and Rudo y Cursi.

<!--ABSTRACT-->

In Busca un Problema _the absent minded boyfriend and his partner,_ the _coach an the new talent,_ and _the tourists in their first time visit_ will find trouble during a bad night in México City.

You'll visit places like _a tunnel with flickering lights_ in **El Metro;** a _cabaret_ in the **Guerrero Borough;** or a _tortería_ across the street from **Arena México.** All in order to **Cozy up to** _your stupid boss_ and **get rid** _of that debt._

Finally, I've also made available a couple of playlists as companion music for the game. All songs that played on the radio of the time.
