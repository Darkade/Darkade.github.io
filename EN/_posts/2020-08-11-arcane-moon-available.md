![Arcane Moon Cover][cover]

[Arcane Moon][arcanemoon] is very 90s, very queer, and very dramatic adventure inspired by Sailor Moon, Cadcaptor Sakura and Magic Knight Rayearth! I wrote it as part of the RPG Writer Workshop, that as the name says was a workshop for people interested in writing for RPGs and getting published.

In Arcane Moon you'll find:

- A queer world full of gender diversity.
- Five maps for two different areas.
â€“ A simplified document for screen readers.
- The main adventure layed out in the style of D&D core books.
- Enough content for five different encounters.

This is the first time I make something like this, and to be honest I feel very satisfied with the results. If you get [Arcane Moon][arcanemoon] all your feed back is very much appreciated since I expect to still do a few changes based on comments.

If this was of your interest you might want to read my other posts on [Dungeons & Dragons] or many other [RPGs].

Thanks for reading!! I hope you enjoy Arcane Moon.
