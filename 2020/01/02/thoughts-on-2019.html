<p>Let’s try this.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>So, 2019 was extremely long and I got to try some new stuff:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I got really into Angular</li>
  <li>I played around with PHP for the first time in, maybe, 10 years</li>
  <li>I finally tried the Kubernetes thing</li>
  <li>And I also learnt the word for this thing you are reading this article on is <em>JAMSTACK</em>
</li>
  <li>I spent more time this year teaching people about Python and Cloud Architecture than any other year before</li>
  <li>Finally I made an effort to actually connect with clients, which I had done before but never proactively</li>
</ul>

<p>What did I got from all of this? Probably that I need to focus more… I like learning and trying new stuff, and that’s the greatest perk of having organised my life the way I have, but it also has meant I haven’t had the chance to specialise as much as I could.</p>

<p>On the other hand, hey! I got to try a lot of new stuff! I’m particularly fond of Angular, while I’ve been using it for years I never tried to make packages or to understand the framework’s architecture. And this year I had to, because I got into my head to use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Custom Elements</a> for a project, which are amazing but are super <a href="https://angular.io/guide/elements" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lazily documented</a>.</p>

<p>We’ve been toying around with making a Wordpress extension, I don’t know if that really counts as PHP, but it turns out I don’t hate PHP as much as I did, it’s just a language… a weird little dirty language that is <strong>AMAZING</strong> at doing weird little dirty things. Probably we wouldn’t have even considered doing the project if we couldn’t have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodging#Cultural_references" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bodge</a> a prototype as fast as we did.</p>

<p>My brain had this thing where it plain refused to acknowledge Kubernetes, but now I’m a convert. I still don’t think I’ll be using it in production soon, but I’m glad to at least know what Kubernetes is.</p>

<p>I had been calling this thing an Static Site Generator, which is accurate, but having a name makes it easier to find resources: Jamstack. I’m still firmly in the Jekyll camp (this is Jekyll after all) but I’ve tried several generators and will be using a Jamstack for any project I can.</p>

<p>This year we had a couple hires, I got hired as Python (and <a href="https://www.informs.org/Resource-Center/INFORMS-Student-Union/Consider-an-Analytics-OR-Career" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OR</a>) tutor, and I wrote here a lot more. So I spent a lot of time explaining stuff to other people. I can’t tell if I’m getting better at it, but I’m no longer repelled by the idea of tutoring someone.</p>

<p>This is the the most significant development in my professional endeavours: I’ve had to manage clients, talk to clients, tried to convince clients all to mixed results. In the past I’ve been responsible for this many times but I never felt like <em>“I had to.”</em> that’s not a nice way to feel. So, it’s taken a lot of emotional work to deal trough the issues that trigger this. But I’m doing better, and I think I’ve been doing a good work dealing with my latest client.</p>

<hr>

<p>So that’s the year, for 2020 I’m thinking about getting some more formal education. After college I worked as a research assistant for a while and I miss the research end of things.</p>

<p>Happy new year to everyone!</p>
